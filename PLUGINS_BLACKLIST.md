## Sublime Text plugins to avoid

- **LuaFormatter**:
    - The binary it ships with is built with the latest versions of everything!!!
    - The binary cannot be installed if one doesn't have the latest version of LuaRocks.
    - The binary cannot be built if one doesn't have the latest versions of the build tools.
    - The binary cannot read from **stdin**.
- **JsPrettier**:
    - It does a trillion lookups to search for a f*cking executable.
    - Slow as hell.
    - It chokes and freezes Sublime Text with files of just a couple of hundreds of Kbs.
- **TrailingSpaces**: SC
- **WordHighlight**: SC
- **DeleteBlankLines**: SC
